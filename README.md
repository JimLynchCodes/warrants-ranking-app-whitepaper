# Warrants Ranking App Whitepaper
Ideas for a freemium model webapp that helps traders compare stock warrants.

## Buy Undervalued & Sell Overvalued

If you knew which warrants were especially undervalued you could buy those.

Also, depending on borring fees, etc- you could short warrants that are especially overvalued.

Consider warrants that are very overpriced and / or have very high borrow fees- are they "overpriced" because people are _overly_ willing to pay a lot for the extrinsic value because they anticipate the price going up? If you think this is the case buying the underlying stock could be a good play. 

Consider warrants that are very overpriced and / or have very high borrow fees- are they "overpriced" because people are _overly_ willing to short the underlying because they think it will go down? If you think this is the case shorting the underlying stock could be a good play. 

Consider warrants that are very overpriced yet still dirt cheap pennies- is it "overpriced" because the fundamental company is unprofitable / mismanaged / plagued by fraud? If you think this is the case shorting the underlying could be a good play.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project began with the great freemium app: [listicktrac.io](listicktrac.io)

Here is an example of some data shown on the "SPAC warrants" page of the site:
